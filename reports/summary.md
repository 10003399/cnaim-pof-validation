Asset Reliability Validation Using CNAIM
Objective

Evaluate whether CNAIM Probability of Failure estimates reflect observed electrical network failures and demonstrate how statistical analysis can support risk-based maintenance decisions.

Workflow

Data validation and structuring

Asset exposure modelling (asset-years)

Reliability analysis (Weibull + Kaplan-Meier)

Model validation against observed failures

CNAIM calibration

Predictive risk modelling

Key Findings

Failures exhibit strong age dependency (wear-out behaviour).

Observed cable failure risk exceeded CNAIM predictions.

Calibration factors improved alignment between model and reality.

Risk ranking enables maintenance prioritization.

Engineering Value

Demonstrates how statistical reliability methods and data science can support predictive maintenance and asset performance management in electrical grids.
